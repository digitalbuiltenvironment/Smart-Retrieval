## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Smart Retrieval is a platform for efficient and streamlined information retrieval, especially in the realm of legal and compliance documents.
With the power of Open-Source Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), it aims to enhance user experiences at JTC by addressing key challenges such as manual search inefficiencies and rigid file naming conventions, revolutionizing the way JTC employees access and comprehend crucial documents
